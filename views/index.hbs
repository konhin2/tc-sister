          Feminism simply means believing that men and women are equal, neither is better than the other and neither should be treated with more respect than the other – everyone should be equal on all levels, simple as that.

          Women actually face sexism every single day. From catcalls in the street to not being taken seriously in the workplace, women face these issues on a daily basis. We need young people to join in the feminist movement so they can help combat this. After all, today’s young people are the leaders of tomorrow.
